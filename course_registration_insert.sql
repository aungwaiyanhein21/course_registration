INSERT INTO Description VALUES(1,"This course will examine the history of African Americans from the Great Migration from the rural South to the urban centers of America beginning at the turn of the new century, the promise of greater opportunities in the aftermath of two World Wars, the catastrophic impact of the Great Depression of the 1930''s, the persistence of violence against blacks in the Jim Crow South and other American cities  during the post World War II period, the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement of the 1950''s and 60''s, and the growing racial consciousness that accompanied demands for empowerment  of black communities through the 1960''s and 70''s into the 21st Century. The artistic expressions of black playwrights, poets, visual and performing artists and filmmakers have been pivotal in understanding African American experience during the 20th Century and in the course, we will focus on a variety of artistic forms to examine this history.");
INSERT INTO Description VALUES(2,"This is an upper level African American Studies course that focuses on critical race theories and empirical research on African Americans in the U.S.  ""Traditional"" academic research on African-Americans documents and explains how racialized systems of inequality operate.  Critical race theory is different because it also explicitly articulates the need for social justice.  Various theoretical approaches will be applied to specific historical developments in U.S. racialized structures as they pertain to African Americans. We will begin by challenging and historicizing the concept of ""race.""  Our attention will then turn to various empirical studies on the position of African Americans within various institutions including, but not limited to labor market, wealth, legal system, education, housing, healthcare, politics, etc.  Then we will examine the various strands of racial ideology that have arisen to legitimate and perpetuate racialized structural inequality.  We spend the remainder of the semester closely examining the theoretical works regarding race which have emerged from legal studies, sociology, politics, and women''s studies.  Prerequisites: AFAM 100, AFAM 209/309, AFAM 310, HIST 247, or SOC 115, or by permission of the instructor.\n");

Prerequisites: Students must be sophomores or above and have taken at least one humanities course at the 200 level or above.");
INSERT INTO Description VALUES(4,"This course introduces students to the development of cultural anthropological theory and practice. It considers important anthropological topics such as myth, religion, gift exchange, totem/taboo, and kinship as a way to approach the comparative study of human societies and cultures. Specific topics include rival concepts of culture, critical senses of differences, and ways diversity is represented in distinctive world-views. The course also samples some current and long lasting issues in interpretive practices and critical theory. No prerequisites.");
INSERT INTO Description VALUES(5,"This course examines the life history, a form of ethnographic literature. Life histories straddle autobiography and biography, historiography and memoir, and constitute a chronicle of the storyteller''s life as it is communicated to their audience, the anthropologist. We will examine the processes that lead to these informative, yet intimate, accounts of individual lives and so understand the value life histories have to empower their narrators and to broaden our knowledge of less examined populations, such as women, the sick, or the poor. We will champion life histories in this course, but will consider critiques of this widely popular method nonetheless. Our reflection on these texts will extend to the manner in which life histories exist as a testament to the worthwhile, but complex, friendships that arise during fieldwork between the narrator and the anthropologist. The course looks to life histories with an eye to content as well as construction, and so students will have the opportunity to collect a life history over the course of the semester.");
INSERT INTO Description VALUES(6,"This course examines collective social action in response to crises and transformations in societies, with a particular focus on millenarian thinking, i.e., the belief that following a major transformation everything will be different, due either to rapture (the rising up of a new, and better, society) or to rupture (the destruction of existing, and good, social order). Various examples of millenarian thinking, including apocalyptic expectations as found in major world and syncretic religions and throughout history and across cultures, are examined. These belief systems often exemplify a wish for or fear of a complete reconfiguration of society through supernatural intercession. We explore the pacifist and violent dimensions of these movements through case studies that include the Shakers, the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project (AKA ""Jonestown""), and Aum Shinrikyo. Also of interest to us are millenarian movements stemming from changes provoked by colonial conquest, including the cargo cults in the Pacific Islands, the events surrounding the Boxer Rebellion in China, the Native American Ghost Dance, and the Santa Brígada in Brazil.

Students will be encouraged to consider each week''s reading from the perspective of their discipline and interests and how it might advance their own thinking.  Student will keep a weekly response journal, compare two or more of the theories presented in a midterm paper, and use one or more of the theoretical perspective presented in an original analysis on a topic of interest to them.  Leading off with Ian Bickford on Roland Barthes and Jane Wanninger on Judith Butler''s Gender Trouble, the series will include sessions with these faculty volunteers: Asma Abbas, Katie Boswell, Jennifer Browdy, Tom Coote, Izabel Filkins, Don McClelland, Aimee Michel, Anne ODwyer, Francisca Oyogoa, Sam Ruhmkorff, and Larry Wallach.
